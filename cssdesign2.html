            <h3>Quarantine</h3>
            <p>What is a Quarantine? </p>
            <p> Quarantine is the complete isolation of healthy people. 
                It is the most critical protective mechanism to reduce the transmission of COVID-19.
            </p>
            <p>
                Quarantine (or so-called self-quarantine) isolates and controls the travel of people 
                who may have been at risk of being contaminated with Covid-19 but appear safe and asymptomatic. 
                A quarantine of 14 days is mandatory which ensures that, in its entirety, the person must be at home, 
                in a hospital or in a special location.

            <h3>Self-Isolation</h3>
            <p>What is Self-isolation?</p>
            <p>Self-isolation means that you are isolated from close contact with any person.</p>
            <p>Self-isolation is required to reduce the transmission of Covid-19 disease, 
                which is already emerging more quickly in other countries than Latvia.</p>

            <h3>Prevention</h3>
            <p>Actions that reduce the chance that good people may get sick.</p>
            <p>Preventive steps against Covid-19 are identical to those for other 
                acute upper respiratory tract infections: washing your hands regularly, 
                particularly after having been in contact with or near sick persons, 
                coughing and sneezing your elbows, using disposable tissue while coughing and sneezing, and then washing your hands.</p>

            <h3>Strict Isolation At Home</h3>
            <p>The most important measure of public safety that can be taken by people who have Covid-19 is complete isolation from healthy people.</p>
            <p>Those with minor symptoms will not need to be diagnosed on an inpatient basis. Doctors can administer home-based 
                treatment in isolation to prevent the spread of the virus. Isolation at home means being at home or at any other place specially 
                chosen for this purpose, in a separate, well-ventilated room and, if possible, with a separate toilet. 
                These precautions are recommended as long as signs are apparent or as long as they are apparent.</p>

            <h3>Physical Distancing</h3>
