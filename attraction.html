                           Adam's peak called in sinhala 'Sri Pada'. From the south-western edge of the hill country, the 
                           rising summit of Adams Peak is at the same time one of Sri Lanka's most natural beauty sights and
                           one of it's most popular places of pilgrimage, a miniature Matterhorn, standing head and shoulder above 
                           the surrounding hills, providing a wonderful illusion of sheer altitude (though at 2243m it is currently only Sri Lanka's fifth highest peak).
                           The mountain has developed a number of legends based on the mysterious depression at its top, the Sri Pada or the Holy Footprint.
                           The original Buddhist myth suggests that this is the signature of the Buddha himself, created at the behest of the local god Saman;
                           it was later changed by various religions to match their own conflicting theologies.
                           Somewhere around the eighth century, Muslims started to say that the footprint was that of Adam, who was supposed to have first set foot 
                           on earth here after being thrown out of heaven, and who stood on the top of the mountain on a leg of repentance until his sins were forgiven 
                           — the Hindu custom, meanwhile, believed that the footprint was formed by Shiva.
                           Many years later, the imperial Portuguese attempted to preserve the imprint of Christian faith, saying that it belonged to that of Adam or that of St. Thomas, 
                           the father of religion in India, but no one seems to have taken this unlikely argument very seriously.

                           The climbing of Adam's Peak is usually made by night, allowing you to
                           reach the top in time for sunrise, which gives the greatest chance of seeing the spectacular
                           sights emerging from the fog, as well as a chance to see the mysterious shadow of the mountain.</p></td>

                                This area is located 148 kilometers east of Colombo, 72 kilometers north of Kandy and 43 kilometers north of Matale Dambulla, the largest public preserved
                                cave temple complex in Sri Lanka. The rock towers are 160 meters above the surrounding plains. There are over 80 known caves in the local area. Major attractions 
                                are scattered over five caves featuring sculptures and paintings. Such paintings and sculptures are related to Gautama Buddha and his life.
                                There are a total of 153 statues of the Buddha, three statues of the Kings of Sri Lanka and four statues of gods and goddesses. Both include Vishnu and Ganesha.
                                The walls occupy an area of 2,100 square metres. The demon Mara's temptation and Buddha's first sermon are portrayed on the walls of the caves.
                                Prehistoric Sri Lankans must have lived in these cave complexes before the advent of Buddhism in Sri Lanka, as there are human skeleton burial sites 
                                about 2700 years old in this area, in Ibbankatuwa, near the Dambulla cave complex.</p></td>

                            Sigiriya or Sinhagiri is an ancient rock fortress situated in the northern Matale district of Dambulla, in the central province of Sri Lanka.
                            The name refers to a site of historical and archeological interest occupied by a huge rock column almost 200m long. According to the ancient Sri Lankan 
                            Chronicle of Culavamsa, this location was selected by King Kashyapa as its new capital. He built his palace on the top of this rock and painted its sides 
                            with colorful paintings.He constructed a gateway in the shape of a massive lion on a small plateau about halfway up the side of this hill. The name of this 
                            location derives from this structure — Sīnhāgiri, the Lion Base. The capital and the royal palace were deserted after the death of the king.Until the 14th century,
                            it was used as a Buddhist monastery. Sigiriya today is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. This is one of the best known examples of ancient town planning.</p></td>

                            complex of the former Kingdom of Kandy, which houses the relic of the Buddha's tooth. The relic has played an significant role in local politics since ancient times, 
                            as it is presumed that whoever owns the relic owns the government of the region. Kandy was the last capital of the kings of Sri Lanka and is a World Heritage Site, 
                            primarily due to the temple. Bhikkhus of the two chapters of Malwatte and Asgiriya frequent worship in the inner chamber of the temple. Rituals are conducted three 
                            times a day: at dawn, at midday and at night. Every Wednesdays, there is a ceremonial replica bathing with a herbal preparation made from scented water and fragrant 
                            flowers called Nanumura Mangallaya. This holy water is believed to possess healing powers and to be spread to those present. The temple sustained damage as a result 
                            of the 1989 bombing of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna and the 1998 Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, but was completely restored every time.</p></td>

                        According to the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, Sinharaja is the last viable primary tropical rainforest region in the world. More than 60 percent of the trees are endemic and others are considered uncommon. 
                        The hilly virgin rainforest, part of the Sri Lankan lowland rainforest ecoregion, was protected from the worst commercial deforestation by inaccessibility and was declared a World Biosphere Reserve in 1978 and a World Heritage Site in 1988.
                        The name of the reserve is translated as the Lion Kingdom. The reserve is just 21 km from east to west and 7 km from north to south, but it is a rich chest of endangered animals, including plants, butterflies, amphibians, rodents, birds and 
                        mammals. Due to dense vegetation, wildlife is not as easily seen as in dry-area national parks such as Yala. There are only three elephants and 15 or so leopards. The most famous major mammal is the endangered purple-faced languide. </p></td>

                        been found spread around Wilpattu. Wilpattu is the largest and oldest national park in Sri Lanka. Wilpattu is one of the world's top national parks, renowned for its leopard population. The Wilderness & Wildlife Conservation Trust conducted 
                        a remote camera survey in Wilpattu from July to October 2015. A group of forty-nine leopards were photographed in the surveyed region and the core region density was between Block I of Yala National Park and the Horton Plains National Park.
                        Between December 1988 to March 16, 2003, the park was closed due to security issues surrounding the Sri Lankan Civil War, before being reopened 16 years later. </p></td>

                        The Park is a dry season feeding ground for the elephant population living in the Matale, Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee forests. The Park generated revenue of Rs. 10.7 million in the six months ending in August 2009.
