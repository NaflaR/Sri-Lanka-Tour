                <p> In coordination with WHO Country Office for Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Health and Local Medical Services continues to 
                    track the situation closely and to improve preparedness and response efforts.
                    We are work closely with main collaborators to fight COVID-19 efficiently and successfully.
                    More than six months since the pandemic, Sri Lanka has made considerable strides in managing the transmission of COVID-19,
                    but the challenge has not yet stopped. We will draw on the gains made to keep ourselves, our loved ones, and our societies safe,
                    stable and prosperous.

                    Rumors and disinformation can make communication and life-saving simpler. They advise everyone to follow high-quality,
                    reliable sources of information that will enable us to remain healthy. Solidarity is one of our greatest weapons. We all
                    have a part to play; it's not an option between life and livelihood.
